### <font size="4">  Why Do the Rich Save So Much? Christopher Carroll (2000)  </font>

What can explain why rich households have higher lifetime saving <b> rates </b>? I've put the emphasis on rates here because rich households obviously save more in terms of quantity of savings (e.g., a dollar amount), but perhaps less obvious is that they also save more in terms of a fraction of their income.

Carroll puts this question in context with two motivating observations. First, from purely a scientific standpoint, the ultra wealthy provide a unique grounds to test economic theories due to the fact they are outliers. Second, from a macroeconomists' perspective, the behaviour of the ultra wealthy have disproportinate impacts on a number of aggregate outcomes. An example of this line of reasoning is the <i> indebted demand </i> theory from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/136/4/2243/6164883" style="color:#1F45FC" target="blank">Mian, Sufi, Straub (2021)</a> paper.

The paper relies on a combination of models and informal evidence, and can really be separated into two sections:

<ol>

<font size="4"> <li> Can standard life cycle models (or variants of it) capture household consumption and saving patterns of the ultra wealthy? </li>

<font size="4"> <li> Informal evidence on why the ultra wealthy save </li>

</ol>

With respect to 1., Carroll contrasts evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances with a standard life cycle model and a "Dynastic" model. The standard life cycle model captures the logic of what most undergraduates students see in two period consumption-saving models. Savings are a means of transfers resources across time, and primarily used to finance future consumption (e.g., I save now so that I have some money for when I'm retired). Nothing inherently jumps out as wrong with this idea until you start to think about the ultra wealthy. The accumulated wealth of the richest people in the world cannot be purely for financing future consumption. As of writing this, Elon Musk is the richest person in the world with an estimated wealth of 278 billion. Let's assume that Musk retires today and lives to 100 (he's 50 now). To consume his current wealth would require that he spend about 5.5 billion a year, or 15 million a day. It simply doesn't add up that saving is only for financing future consumption, even if death is uncertain. One empirical fact Carroll notes that goes against the purely life cycle hypothesis narrative is: If households savings are mainly for retirement, we would expect to see retired households hold a lot of their wealth in annuities since this limits exposure to mortality risk. Now it is worth noting that there are other risks for which households would want some liquid assets, such as unexpected large healthcare costs [1]. But for the average household over 65, only 55% of their wealth was in annuities, and for richest 1 percent, only 10%. Much smaller than one would expect if we are taking the life cycle model at face value.

This naturally leds into the Dynastic model
