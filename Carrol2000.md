### <font size="4">  Why Do the Rich Save So Much? Christopher Carroll (2000)  </font>

What can explain why rich households have higher lifetime saving <b> rates </b>? I've put the emphasis on rates here because rich households obviously save more in terms of quantity of savings (e.g., a dollar amount), but perhaps less obvious is that they also save more in terms of a fraction of their income.

Carroll puts this question in context with two motivating observations. First, from purely a scientific standpoint, the ultra wealthy provide a unique grounds to test economic theories due to the fact they are outliers. Second, from a macroeconomists' perspective, the behaviour of the ultra wealthy have disproportinate impacts on a number of aggregate outcomes. An example of this line of reasoning is the <i> indebted demand </i> theory from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/136/4/2243/6164883" style="color:#1F45FC" target="blank">Mian, Sufi, Straub (2021)</a> paper.

The paper relies on a combination of models and informal evidence, and can really be separated into two sections: (1) Can standard life cycle models (or variants of it) capture household consumption and saving patterns of the ultra wealthy? and (2) Informal evidence on why the ultra wealthy save.

With respect to (1), Carroll contrasts evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances with a standard life cycle model and a "Dynastic" model. The standard life cycle model captures the logic of what most undergraduates students see in two period consumption-saving models. Savings are a means of transfers resources across time, and primarily used to finance future consumption (e.g., I save now so that I have some money for when I'm retired). Nothing inherently jumps out as wrong with this idea until you start to think about the ultra wealthy. The accumulated wealth of the richest people in the world cannot be purely for financing future consumption. As of writing this, Elon Musk is the richest person in the world with an estimated wealth of 278 billion. Let's assume that Musk retires today and lives to 100 (he's 50 now). To consume his current wealth would require that he spend about 5.5 billion a year, or 15 million a day. It simply doesn't add up that saving is only for financing future consumption, even if death is uncertain. One empirical fact Carroll notes that goes against the purely life cycle hypothesis narrative is: If households savings are mainly for retirement, we would expect to see retired households hold a lot of their wealth in annuities since this limits exposure to mortality risk. Now it is worth noting that there are other risks for which households would want some liquid assets, such as unexpected large healthcare costs [1]. But for the average household over 65, only 55% of their wealth was in annuities, and for richest 1 percent, only 10%. Much smaller than one would expect if we are taking the life cycle model at face value.

Something missing in the standard life cycle model, which most people would find reasonable, is that wealthy individuals may want to share their wealth with future generations through bequests. Carroll refers to this model as the Dynastic model. This is typically done by including future generations utility in the household utility function. But the Dynastic model also exhibits behaviour which is at odds with a number of empirical facts for rich households. For one, in survey evidence almost no one, rich or otherwise, listed inheritance as an important reason for saving (2-3% said it was). Two, if the primary driver of wealth accumulation was to share wealth with future generations, we would expect to see drastically different dissaving (spending in retirement) behaviour between households with children and those without. While evidence on the latter is scant in the SCF, there isn't a noticeable difference in spending behaviour in retirement between those with children and those without. In fact, survey evidence asking if spending exceeded income showed the opposite pattern, households with children were dissaving faster. What about chartible donations? Carroll cites a few works which again suggest there is not a significant difference between those with children and those without.

So what can explain wealth accumulation by the rich if it isn't for future consumption or bequests? One candidate is that households enjoy wealth directly, which may distill a number of benefits such as status, power, or a reflection of their job performance, from which they derive satisfaction. Since wealth captures these streams, instead of trying to model them specifically, we can simply include wealth as something people enjoy. Carroll refers to this setup as the "Capitalist Spirit" model after Max Weber, who argued that the spirit of capitalism itself was the pursuit of wealth. Carrol proposes a specific utility function where wealth yields utility in a Stone-Geary form. Critically, the utility function generates a concave saving rate as a function of wealth for calibrations in which the marginal utility of consumption declines faster than the marginal utility of wealth. In these calibrations, wealth acts a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods" style="color:#1F45FC" target="blank">luxury good</a>. Then for low levels of wealth the saving rate is zero, and as wealth tends to infinity, the saving rate approaches 1. The informal evidence on ultra wealthy tends to support the mathematical description provided by the Capitalist Spirit model.

Finally, Carroll raises some normative issues if individuals do behave according to the Capitalist Spirit model. For example, what is the optimal tax rate?
