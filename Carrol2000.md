### <font size="4">  Why Do the Rich Save So Much? Christopher Carroll (2000)  </font>

What can explain why rich households have higher lifetime saving <b> rates </b>? I've put the emphasis on rates here because rich households obviously save more in terms of quantity of savings (e.g., a dollar amount), but perhaps less obvious is that they also save more in terms of a fraction of their income.

Carroll puts this question in context with two motivating observations. First, from purely a scientific standpoint, the ultra wealthy provide a unique grounds to test economic theories due to the fact they are outliers. Second, from a macroeconomists' perspective, the behaviour of the ultra wealthy have disproportinate impacts on a number of aggregate outcomes. An example of this line of reasoning is evident in the <i> indebted demand </i> theory from Mian, Sufi, and Straub.

The paper relies on a combination of models and informal evidence, and can really be separated into two sections:

<ol>

<li> Can standard life cycle models (or variants of it) capture household consumption and saving patterns of the ultra wealthy?

<li> Informal evidence on why the ultra wealthy save

</ol>
